      <h1>Choosing Fullstack Development</h1>
      <p class="post-meta"><em>Published: September 2025</em></p>

      <p>When I reached the specialization phase of the Power Learn Project (PLP), I was faced with one of the hardest decisions so far â€” which path to choose. There were multiple options: frontend, backend, data science, and cybersecurity. Each of them sounded exciting, but I knew I had to pick one that would shape my career direction.</p>

      <p>At first, I leaned towards AI and data because they are trending, but I quickly realized that having strong fundamentals in software engineering would be critical before diving deeper into AI. This realization gave me clarity: fullstack development would give me the foundation to build complete systems â€” from user interfaces to server logic.</p>

      <p>It wasnâ€™t an easy decision. I spent days thinking about it, asking mentors for advice, and comparing job opportunities. Finally, I chose fullstack development because it keeps my options open. With fullstack skills, I can work on real projects end-to-end, collaborate with teams effectively, and even explore AI later with a strong understanding of how software works.</p>

      <p>This decision has brought me peace and motivation. Now, every lesson I take feels like an investment in my ability to build products and solve real problems. Itâ€™s a reminder that tech isnâ€™t just about trends â€” itâ€™s about building a foundation that allows you to grow.</p>
