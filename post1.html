      <p>Joining the Power Learn Project (PLP) web development track was one of the best decisions I have made so far. At first, I had no idea what to expect â€” just excitement and a bit of nervousness. The first few weeks were about grasping the basics of HTML and CSS, which felt like learning a new language. Soon after, we moved into JavaScript, and thatâ€™s when things got even more interesting.</p>

      <p>One of my biggest wins was understanding how all the pieces fit together â€” semantic HTML, responsive layouts with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript. I built small projects along the way, tested ideas, and got better at debugging.</p>

      <p>The highlight was the final project where I had to bring everything together in a multi-page, responsive website and deploy it. Seeing my site live on the internet for the first time gave me a huge confidence boost. This experience taught me that consistency matters more than speed â€” showing up daily to code slowly built my skills.</p>

      <p>PLP not only gave me technical skills but also connected me to a community of learners who are passionate about tech and growth. Iâ€™m grateful for the mentorship and support that kept me motivated along the way.</p>
